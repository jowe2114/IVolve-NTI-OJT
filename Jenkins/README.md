Kubernetes Deployment using Master-Slave Jenkins

Overview

This project is a demonstration of a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins. The pipeline is designed to build a Docker image of the application, push it to Docker Hub, and deploy it to an OpenShift cluster. The Jenkins pipeline leverages a master-slave architecture and utilizes a shared Jenkins library for modular and reusable pipeline code.
